please note that this project is actively in development.
if you find any bugs, then report them and I will try to adress them.
it's currently very barebones and will likely remain so.

this is for a digital tech project(i.e something I made while at school). it probably wont go too in-depth, but if it still looks like a barebones unity prototype by the end of this then I procrastinated.

UPDATE: it is no longer a barebones unity prototype. I am satisfied with it. enemy AI would be really cool, but a win condition is also needed.
