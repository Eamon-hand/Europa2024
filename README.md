please note that this project is actively in development.
if you find any bugs, then report them and I will try to adress them.
it's currently very barebones. don't expect much at this stage.

this is for a digital tech project(i.e something I made while at school). it probably wont go too in-depth, but if it still looks like a barebones unity prototype by the end of this then I procrastinated.
